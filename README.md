const_blpath : Code for constructing the black line for pair of nodes.
pltgraph : small dot2tex code for visualising small graphs
spath : shortest path codes
tmpprog : backup files
altptrivial.cpp : Single via path using floyd warshall
*pplt.cpp : path plotting using leaflet
ch_pen.cpp : penalty algorithm for paths
aug_altpath : augmented alternate paths
dobp_as.cpp : Maybe double via path
